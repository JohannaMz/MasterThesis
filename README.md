# MasterThesis
Code for my master thesis.
The code is split into data preparation (WU_preparation) for the counties Hessen and Baden-Württemberg. All predictors for the SDM are prepared in the same way, so that the model can be projected.
WU_Question1_analysis describes the SDM modelling and the projection into Baden-Württemberg.
WU_QUestion2_analysis described the comparison with the modelled risk probability and analysis of the roe deer crossings.
