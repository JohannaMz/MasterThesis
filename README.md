# MasterThesis
Code for my master thesis.
The code is split into data preparation (WU_preparation) for the counties Hessen and Baden-Württemberg. All predictors for the SDM are prepared in the same way, so that the model can be projected.
WU_analysis described the SDM modelling approach, the projection into Baden-Württemberg and the comparison and analysis of the roe deer crossings.
